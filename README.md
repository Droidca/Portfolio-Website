# portfolio-website
To check my portfolio in browser, you can just acess my website in the About Me Section of this Github page.

To check my code you can download my files and open them in your coding app of choice (e.g. Atom), or directly in this Github page by just clicking the html or css files (this last one inside the css folder.)

In the CSS folder you will find 2 files. The styles.css is where I make my design changes. The style.production.css file is the styles.css code after proprocessing, and the css file responsible for my active website design.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me through my email in my contact page.
